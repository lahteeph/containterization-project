# containerization-project
# Objectives
## Create a simple web application:
  - Use Python Programming Language to create your simple application
  - The application should display a simple message like "Hello, Welcome to KodeCamp DevOps Bookcamp!"
  - You can give your app more features if you choose to.
## Dockerize the application:
  - Write a Dockerfile to containerize the application.
  - Build the Docker image and run it locally to ensure it works correctly.
  - Tag it and Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
## Deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster:
  - Create a Kubernetes manifest file for a Deployment to deploy the Docker image.
  - Deploy the app to your minikube cluster
  - Create a Kubernetes Service of type ClusterIP to expose the application.
## Test the deployment:
  - Port-forward your service to a localhost port and access it through your web browser.
  - Verify that the application displays the expected message.

# Steps in Acheivng the above objectives
## Directory and file structure for the project.

## Requirements
  - docker
  - docker compose
  - linux host
  - see https://docs.docker.com/manuals/
    
to make the project more realistic lets use a web template.
log-on to https://templatemo.com to download any template of ur choice.
in my case i chose the bellow template.
unzip it, in my case i also made some changes.

  - create a directory "kodecamp-web", cd into the directory and create file with respect to the above project structure
  - unzip the downloaded template and place it in the directory.

  - "Flask" as said earlier is a web framework for phython
  - Werkzeug provides a foundation for Flask's request and response handling, routing, and other core functionality. Werkzeug is a dependency of Flask.

## Dockerfile
  - ![Screenshot from 2024-08-02 21-39-59](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7f0a52b-e0a6-4981-bae4-5c7432ceea84)

  - NOTE: "Dockerfile" does not have any extension.
  - see https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/ for more understanding

# Build the Docker image and run it locally to ensure it works correctly.
  - Run "Docker build -t kodecamp-web . (to build the image created)
  - ![Screenshot from 2024-08-02 22-14-54](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68190030-1dfe-4c09-851d-ae003fb785e1)

  - Our image is successfully build, lets verify by running "docker images".
  - ![Screenshot from 2024-08-02 22-37-02](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/028b903c-b4c5-49c5-acc7-a8811dd9cb20)

## testing the build image
  - Run "docker run --name kodecamp-web -p 8000:5000 kodecamp-web (for spining up our build image and port forwarding)
  - ![Screenshot from 2024-08-02 22-46-31](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93581f19-8244-4249-bd45-93bbdda598ec)

  - visit http://yourhostip:8000 on your browser to test ur container.
  - ![Screenshot from 2024-08-02 20-46-02](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6668d909-b3cb-4e09-90c3-f4eeffe2cc1a)

  - while on your browser you can also check your backend host, you should be seeing the request sent to the front end and the ip the request is coming from.
  - !![Screenshot from 2024-08-02 23-01-06](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81bca0ea-6a64-4744-a85e-56ca0f43dc19)

  - Note: the container can also be runing in backgroud by add "-d" to the comand.
  - "docker run --name kodecamp-web -d -p 8000:5000 kodecamp-web (for runing container at first)
  - "docker run -d -p 8000:5000 kodecamp-web (for starting already provisioned container)
  - run "docker ps -a" to check the processess runing in background.

  - to stop your container, run "docker stop (your container id)
    
# Tag it and Push the Docker image to a container registry
  - i need to open an account on https://hub.docker.com and login your account details to link your host.

# Deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster:
## Deploy the app to your minikube cluster
  ## requirements
  - install minikube (see https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Flinux%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2Fbinary+download)

  - Create the Deployment by running the following command: kubectl apply -f kuber_deployment.yaml or kubectl create -f kuber_deployment.yaml
  - Run "kubectl get pod" to veruty if the pod is created
  - Run "kubectl get deployments" to check if the Deployment is created.

# Additional Configuration
## Configure a ConfigMap to externalize the message "Hello, Kubernetes!" and update your application to read this message from the ConfigMap.
## Create a Secret to store a sensitive piece of information (e.g., a password) and update your application to use this Secret.
  - create a configMap.yaml file:
